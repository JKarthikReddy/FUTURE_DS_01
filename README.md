# Data Science & Analytics Internship – Future Interns

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Data Science & Analytics Internship** at **Future Interns**!

This repository contains:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks
- Data preprocessing and cleaning scripts
- Machine learning models (regression, classification, etc.)
- Visualizations to uncover patterns and trends
- Reports and documentation for each assignment

## About the Internship
This internship is helping me build practical experience in data analysis, Python programming, and machine learning. I’m working on real-world datasets to solve problems and develop actionable insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Data visualization and statistical analysis

## Goals
✅ Learn data manipulation and preprocessing  
✅ Implement machine learning algorithms  
✅ Build insightful visualizations  
✅ Share knowledge and progress on LinkedIn  
✅ Collaborate with other interns and improve problem-solving skills
